       "'René Stauffer 72 Andre Agassi as the favorite and himself and Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain as  the leading contenders for the No. 2 position. Federer’s assessment quickly  proved to be wrong. Federer beat Ferrero in his opening round-robin match  and then defeated Jiri Novak for a 2-0 round robin record. Federer then  clinched his round-robin flight when Agassi lost to both Novak and Ferrero.  No longer with a chance of making the semifinals, Agassi hastily left China in  disappointment, using a hip injury as the reason for his withdrawal. In the semifinals, Federer faced Hewitt, who already clinched the year-end  No. 1 ranking for a second year in a row. The Australian barely qualified for  the semifinals and benefited from Carlos Moya winning a three-hour mean- ingless match over fellow Spaniard Costa, where a Costa victory would have  him reach the semifinals rather than Hewitt. Although Federer lost five of the  last seven matches with Hewitt, he reasoned his chances of beating him and  winning the first big championship of his career were very attainable. Federer started his semifinal with Hewitt in furious fashion, taking a 3-0  and a 5-2 first-set lead, but Hewitt ran and fought as if his life were at stake.  Hewitt fought off five set points and rallied for a 6-5 lead. Serving for the  set, Hewitt staved off another five break points, before capturing the first  set 7-5. Federer, however, was not ready to surrender. The second set turned  into a wild back-and-forth struggle. Hewitt served for the match at 5-4 and  held match point, but Federer broke back for 5-5. After holding serve for  6-5, Federer evened the match by breaking Hewitt’s serve, connecting on his  fourth set point of the game.  The Chinese fans went wild—out of their seats, screaming and cheering. In  the commentary booth high above the stadium, Heinz Günthardt and Stefan  Bürer, the Swiss TV commentary team, described the tension and fast-paced  action to the audience back in Switzerland, where it was Saturday morning  and many people postponed their weekend shopping to watch the dramatic  match with their new sports hero. As the match extended into a third hour, the breaks seemed to fall in favor  of Federer. Leading 4-3 in the final set, Federer held two break points to put  him in the position to serve for the match. Both opportunities, however,  were lost and Hewitt held for 4-4. Hewitt then subsequently broke Federer’s'"

       "['95 Chapter 19 Duels in Texas In 2003, Roger Federer won six tournaments on all different surfaces—indoors  in Marseille and Vienna, hard courts in Dubai, clay in Munich and grass in  Halle and at Wimbledon. However, a gap in his resume was the absence of  a tournament title in North America. Of the 21 tournaments he played on  the North American continent since he turned professional, 10 ended in the  first round. On only one occasion—in Key Biscayne in 2002—did he manage  to make his way into a singles final. He wasn’t even able to muscle his way  as far as the quarterfinals at the US Open or at the big events in Cincinnati  or Indian Wells.',\n",
       " '74 Chapter 15 The Grand Slam Block Roger Federer’s declared goal for 2003 was, as before, to win a Grand Slam  tournament. He finally wanted to rid himself of the moniker as the best  player in tennis without a Grand Slam title. In his 14 career Grand Slam  tournament appearances, his best results were two modest quarterfinal fin- ishes—both achieved in 2001. Coach Peter Lundgren still displayed an unshakable belief in Federer. He  constantly repeated the mantra in his sonorous voice that Federer required  more time than others to fully develop. “',\n",
       " '79 Chapter 16 A Magic Sunday Two weeks after his ill-fated appearance against Luis Horna at the 2003  French Open, Roger Federer was back on his saddle. The loss to Horna seemed  like a surreal dream, but Federer’s fortunes quickly changed for the better. He  reached the final of fashion entrepreneur Gerry Weber’s fancy pre-Wimbledon  grass court tournament in Halle, Germany, where he faced Germany’s Nicolas  Kiefer. Despite losing all three previous matches with Kiefer, Federer gave him  no quarter and won his fourth title of the year—and his first on grass since  he won the junior title at Wimbledon in 1998. “ Prospects for Wimbledon are  good,” he said after his win in Halle. “',\n",
       " 'It also helped Federer establish one of the most unbeliev- able records in sports history—24 consecutive victories in professional singles  finals between July of 2003 and November of 2005—double the record held  by John McEnroe and Björn Borg. Federer’s triumphs at this World Youth Cup were in vain. The Swiss team,  lacking a strong second singles player and an experienced doubles team, fin- ished the tournament in defeat in 15th place. Roger Federer won but the  Swiss lost—a scenario that was to repeat itself many times over years later at  the actual Davis Cup. The hot-head nonetheless received a compliment from  the coach of the Australian team at the World Youth Cup, Darren Cahill,',\n",
       " 'René Stauffer 108 There would be no discussion among experts in the tennis industry of  the validity of the No. Having won Wimbledon, the Tennis  Masters Cup and the Australian Open, Federer won three of the five most im- portant titles in tennis in the last seven months. His success equaled the best  run of success in men’s tennis since Hewitt captured titles at Wimbledon, the  US Open and the Tennis Masters Cup over a stretch of 10 months in 2001  and 2002.  The transitional phase in men’s tennis that produced eight different Grand  Slam tournament champions over a two-year-stretch was over.',\n",
       " 'I have played well all week and it gives  me great confidence going into the French Open.” Federer cracks the top 10  in the rankings the next day by virtue of his effort. June 25, 2002  Tagged as a pre-tournament dark horse favorite to win Wimbledon,  Federer is beaten badly on Centre Court at the All England Club in the first  round, losing to 18-year-old qualifier Mario Ancic of Croatia 6-3, 7-6 (2), 6-3.  July 6, 2003  Federer wins a Grand Slam tournament for the first time, defeat- ing Mark Philippoussis 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-6 (3) in the gentlemen’s singles final  at Wimbledon. The 21-year-old Federer becomes the first Swiss man in 117  editions of The Championships to win the title.',\n",
       " 'He won all  ten tournaments in the “International Series” that he competed in between  March, 2004 and January, 2006—an incredibly consistent performance. Federer’s strategy of looking at the big picture has panned out. He has de- veloped into the champion that he is today because he hasn’t been sidetracked  by distractions and has remained focused on the lone goal of maximizing his  on-court performance. His successes and his reputation as a champion with  high credibility have increased his marketability over the years. The number of Federer’s advertising contracts was always manageable—in  contrast to Björn Borg, for example, who had to keep 40 contract partners  satisfied when he was in his prime.',\n",
       " 'Federer hits 21 aces and 50  winners against only nine unforced errors in the one hour and 56-minute final.  “It’s an absolute dream for me coming true,” said Federer after the victory.  November 16, 2003  Federer routs Andre Agassi 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 to win the year- end Tennis Masters Cup for the first time in his career. Playing at the Westside  Tennis Club in Houston, Texas, Federer fires 11 aces in the 88-minute match  delayed two-and-a-half hours due to rain. “ It was one of the best matches  for me this season,” said Federer. “',\n",
       " 'To fulfill my dreams, it really means very much to me.” July 4, 2004  Federer wins Wimbledon for a second consecutive time, defeating  first-time finalist Andy Roddick 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (3), 6-4 in the men’s singles  final.  July 11, 2004  Federer wins his first pro singles title on Swiss soil at the Swiss  Open in Gstaad, defeating Igor Andreev of Russia 6-2, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 in the  final. August 1, 2004  On Switzerland’s national holiday and on the second anniver- sary of the death of his coach Peter Carter, Federer defeats Andy Roddick 7-5,  6-3 in the final of the Canadian Open in Toronto. Federer also becomes the  first player since Björn Borg in 1979 to win three consecutive tournaments on  three different surfaces—grass, clay and hard courts.',\n",
       " ' I don’t want to lose in the first round at Roland Garros again.” On a summery Monday afternoon in Paris, Federer’s first match at the  2003 French Open took place on Court Philippe Chatrier, the center court  named after the Frenchman who was a past president of the International  Tennis Federation. His opponent was an unknown Peruvian Luis Horna,  whom Federer beat earlier in the year in Key Biscayne. 88  in the world, had yet to win a match at a Grand Slam tournament.']"
